Linking SmallLuxSU statically or dynamically with other modules is
making a combined work based on SmallLuxSU. Thus, the terms and conditions
of the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.
 
In addition, as a special exception, the copyright holders of SmallLuxSU
give you permission to combine SmallLuxSU program with free software
programs or libraries that are released under the GNU LGPL and with code
included in the standard release of SketchUp, SketchUp Make or SketchUp Pro
under, respectively, the SketchUp, Sketchup Make or SketchUp Pro license
(or modified versions of such code, with unchanged license). You may copy
and distribute such a system following the terms of the GNU GPL for
SmallLuxSU and the licenses of the other code concerned, provided that
you include the source code of that other code when and as the GNU GPL
requires distribution of source code.

Note that people who make modified versions of SmallLuxSU are not obligated
to grant this special exception for their modified versions; it is their
choice whether to do so. The GNU General Public License gives permission
to release a modified version without this exception; this exception also
makes it possible to release a modified version which carries forward this
exception.
